Foundations of Prompt Engineering

FM - Foundation Models
LM - Language Models


FMs include LLM's, Amazon Titan, Meta Llama 2, Anthropic Claude, AI21 Labs Jurassic-2 Ultra,


Self-supervised learning

Once a Model is trained (pre-trained) on Data un-supervised, it can
undergo

Fine-Tuning:
Instruction fine tuning:
the model is shown examples of correct or desireed outcomes.
this may include Prompt tuning and RLHF or Real Life Human Feedback.

Prompt-Enginerring:
Like Fine-Tuning but without labeld data. The model is instructed
through the prompts.




Elements of a prompt:

Instruction:
Write an email describing this memo in two sentances.

Context:
Scope: inter office, multiple groups

Input Data:
The Memo

Output Indicator:
Two sentance email




Best Practice:


State the goal:
who, what where, why, how,

Describe the Output:
State Format or give Examples, provide default response. (avoid Hallucinations)
Explictly state the solution space:
a) I dont know
b) Before the year 2000
c) After the year 2000

Provide Context:
In Music, what is a scale?


Breakup Tasks:
From this data remove all negative values
Take that response and find the averge




Prompt Types:

Zero-shot prompting:
Little or no context or preperation




CoT Prompting
Chain Of Thought

(Provide Context through an Example Question and Answer)

------------ take all this paste it into ChatGBT ---------------------------------
The Spotify proceeds were this

Sept  = $500
Nov   = $400
Dec   = $300

Question: Esitmate the Spotify proceeds for Jan
Answer:   Based on the Data provided the trend seems to be downward at
	  $100 a month. If that trend proceeds Jan proceeds will be $200

Question: Explaining the steps Estimate the proceeds for the Feb, and March following Jan?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Advanced Prompt Techniques:

Self-Consistency: Demonstrate the Logical method you want used to solve the question.
                  this seems related to the Spotify example above.

RAG
Retrieval Augmented Generation (getting real time Data ?? )


Both ART and ReAct seem to be enabling the LLM to use predefined external tools
ART
Automatic Reasoning and Tool-use


ReAct
Resoning and Action
This seems to be when an LLM LM can access API's (Calculator, SQL data base)
